We are providing users the ability to migrate their Paratext Supporter accounts and reclaim their archived SITE_NAME accounts. This means that you will retain access to your posts, comments, badges, etc. In order to do so, you will need to enter the email address associated with your original Paratext Support account in the box below and follow the steps. You will be given the option to change your username and any other account information.<br><br>If you wish to leave your account archived and create a new account instead, you may do so by <a href='https://supportsitetest.tk/register' rel='noopener noreferrer'>registering an account</a>. If you register with the same email address associated with your archived account, that account will remain archived and your new account will share no relation to it.<br><br><b>Please note</b> that the decision to reclaim your existing account or register a new account is <b>final</b> and cannot be reversed.
