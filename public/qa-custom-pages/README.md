# Custom Pages For Q2A site

This directory contains the HTML files for custom pages for the Q2A site. Yes, you can create custom pages through the admin page, but if the database is reset, custom pages can be lost. Thus, storing the HTML for the pages here allows us to back them up in case they are lost.
