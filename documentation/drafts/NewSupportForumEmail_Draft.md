Hello SUPPORT_FORUM_USERNAME,

The Paratext Supporter Forum, previously located at support.paratext.org, has moved to a new website, [SITE_NAME](https://supportsitetest.tk), as a part of the process of unifying the communities who use various Bible translation softwares.
All data, such as users, posts, images, and roles, from the original support forum has been migrated to the new forum.
Since this forum is publicly viewable to anyone without needing a verified account, all identifiable information (such as names, locations, and addresses) has been anonymized.

If you wish to retain all of your posts and data, you may [reclaim your previous account](https://supportsitetest.tk/recover-account).
Otherwise, you may [register a new account](https://supportsitetest.tk/register), instead.
Please note that if you choose to create a new account and use the same email address that was associated with your support.paratext.org account, you will **not** be able to reclaim any of your data.
