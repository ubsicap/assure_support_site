A page we can link users to about posting etiquette and warning that the site is public.

SITE_NAME is a publicly available forum for Bible translators worldwide.
This, of course, means that people using this forum may have need or desire to remain anonymous.
Our goal is to provide a secure, resourceful community for individuals and organizations using Bible translation tools.
We ask that you keep this in mind when you post content on the forum that includes identifying information, such as locations, languages, names, etc.
The safety of our users is of upmost importance, and together we can assist one another in furthering the translation of God's Word.

We ask you to refrain from posting any of the following content:

-   **Real names, nicknames, or titles**. Refer to users by their [@username](https://supportsitetest.tk/users).
-   **Account login credentials**, such as email addresses and passwords.
-   **Locations**, such as countries, cities, or towns.
-   **Photos** of people, places, buildings, etc.
-   **Organizations** or names of local groups.
-   **Phone numbers**.
-   **IP Addresses**.

We acknowledge that it is necessary in some situations to post specific details in order to get proper assistance.
So, while we permit the following content to be posted, we ask that you use the utmost caution when posting any of it:

-   **Language information**, such as names, locations where used, etc. Especially for sensitive areas that are known to be unfriendly towards Bible translation.
-   **Workplace details**, such as companies, projects, or locations.
-   **Social media information**, such as usernames or profile links.
-   **Screenshots** of projects, texts, languages, etc.
-   **Holidays** or events local to sensitive areas.
